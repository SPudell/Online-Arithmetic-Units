# Online-Arithmetic-Units
Online arithmetic units compute results of operations in a digit-by-digit manner starting with the most significant digit. Because of the use of redundant number representations for the operands carry-free computations are possible. That advantage is used in this work to build arithmeitc units with arbitrary precision.
